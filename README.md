# resumewebsite

This version of my resume Website has a ChatBot attached which can take care of FAQ's. It's still a work in progress.
This project uses a FLASK microframework, and enables the backend to do the heavy work in Python while presenting a user friendly 
HTML page that also incorporates JS, Bootstrap & CSS. Please check out a simplified version with no Chatbot and no
flask framework @ https://cchandel-simple-resume-app.herokuapp.com/.
